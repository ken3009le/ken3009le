- 🤖 Hi, I’m @ken3009le  
- 🕵️‍♂️ I’m passionate about cybersecurity, hacking, reverse engineering, and uncovering hidden vulnerabilities in complex systems  
- 📚 As a student (I was born in 2011 so...) by day and a hacker by night, I’m constantly learning advanced penetration testing, exploit crafting, and stealth techniques that push the boundaries of traditional security  
- 🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on cutting edge security research, offensive tool development, and projects that challenge the norms of digital defense  
- 📬 How to reach me: ken3009le@gmail.com feel free to connect if you’re into exploring the grey areas of cybersec or want to exchange ideas on hacking  
- 🧑‍🎓 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don’t just break systems I rewrite their rules. When the world builds walls, I build the logic that makes them fall  
AYOO IM ALSO WANT TO BECOME A MALWARE DEVELOPER
